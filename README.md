# Etch a Sketch Project

 - Idea is to have the program generate a grid based on a 
   square of a user input.

 - Think CSS Grid is what i need here and am learning it while 
   I think of some ideas.

| HTML | CSS | JS |
| ----------- | ----------- | ----------- |
| Boilerplate | Grid on main div | create div's per input
| One div | rules for smaller "pixels" | apply styles per input
